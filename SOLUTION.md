# Solution for MCP Server Error

## The Problem

You're seeing a Zod validation error when Claude starts up and tries to connect to your OpenAI image generation MCP server. The error indicates that Claude is receiving a message with unexpected structure.

## Solutions (Try in Order)

### 1. Quick Fix - Use the V2 Server

This updated server handles the MCP protocol more robustly:

```bash
# Copy this configuration to Claude's config directory
cp claude_desktop_config_v2.json ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json

# Restart Claude
```

### 2. Debug the Issue

If the quick fix doesn't work, use the debug proxy to see what's happening:

```bash
# Copy the debug configuration
cp claude_debug_config.json ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json

# Restart Claude

# Check the debug log
tail -f mcp-debug.log
```

### 3. Manual Test

Test if the server works correctly outside of Claude:

```bash
node test-mcp.js
```

If this works but Claude doesn't, the issue is with Claude's configuration.

### 4. Clear Claude's Cache

Sometimes Claude's cache can cause issues:

```bash
# Quit Claude completely first
rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/Cache/
rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/Code\ Cache/
```

### 5. Check Permissions

Make sure all scripts are executable:

```bash
chmod +x src/mcp-server.js
chmod +x src/mcp-server-v2.js
chmod +x src/mcp-proxy.js
```

## Files Created

1. **mcp-server-v2.js** - Improved MCP server that handles protocol more robustly
2. **mcp-proxy.js** - Debug proxy that logs all communication
3. **test-mcp.js** - Test script to verify server functionality
4. **Multiple config files** - Different configurations for testing

## What the V2 Server Does Differently

1. Validates JSON-RPC version in requests
2. Handles notifications properly
3. Sends responses immediately for initialization
4. Returns proper error responses for invalid requests
5. Doesn't respond to notifications (which was causing the error)

## Expected Behavior

When working correctly:

1. Claude should start without errors
2. You should be able to use commands like "Generate an image of a cat"
3. Images will be saved to the `generated-images` directory

## If Nothing Works

1. Check if Node.js is properly installed: `node --version`
2. Verify the OpenAI API key is valid
3. Try running Claude from the terminal to see console output
4. Share the contents of `mcp-debug.log` for further debugging

## Contact

If you continue to have issues, the debug log from the proxy will show exactly what messages are being exchanged, which will help identify the problem.
